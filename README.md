# Shake

  
## This is a toy Kotlin application which provided an opportunity to get some experience with: 
--- 
* Kotlin  
* Android's accelerometer  
* [GraphView library](http://www.android-graphview.org/)  
* Writing data to a file that can be uploaded from the Android device for analysis

### The app obtains accelerometer sensor data and plots the X,Y,Z acceleration components along with a shake detector signal which rises to a "shake state" when the device is subjected to an acceleration of more than 2 gs.
